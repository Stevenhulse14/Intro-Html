## Challenge

For this challenge you will be combining what you have learned so far about HTML to build a web page from scratch. You are given an example image, but you will have to write the HTML yourself, with the help of a few references. Your implementation doesn't have to look absolutely identical to the reference image, but get as close as you can. It should be difficult to notice any differences.

Complete `index.html` to create a page that looks as close to the provided `example.png` as possible. You should not need to create or modify any other files.
